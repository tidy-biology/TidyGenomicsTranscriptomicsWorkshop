# Part 1 Introduction to tidySingleCellExperiment

```{r message = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(colorspace)
library(dittoSeq)
```

SingleCellExperiment is a very popular analysis toolkit for single cell RNA sequencing data [@butler2018integrating; @stuart2019comprehensive].

Here we load single-cell data in SingleCellExperiment object format. This data is peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from metastatic breast cancer patients.


```{r}
# load single cell RNA sequencing data
sce_obj <- tidyomicsWorkshop::sce_obj

# take a look
sce_obj
```

tidySingleCellExperiment provides a bridge between the SingleCellExperiment single-cell package and the tidyverse [@wickham2019welcome]. It creates an invisible layer that enables viewing the SingleCellExperiment object as a tidyverse tibble, and provides SingleCellExperiment-compatible *dplyr*, *tidyr*, *ggplot* and *plotly* functions.

If we load the *tidySingleCellExperiment* package and then view the single cell data, it now displays as a tibble.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidySingleCellExperiment)

sce_obj
```

If we want to revert to the standard SingleCellExperiment view we can do that.

```{r}
options("restore_SingleCellExperiment_show" = TRUE)
sce_obj
```

If we want to revert back to tidy SingleCellExperiment view we can.

```{r}
options("restore_SingleCellExperiment_show" = FALSE)
sce_obj
```

It can be interacted with using [SingleCellExperiment commands](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/SingleCellExperiment/inst/doc/intro.html) such as `assays`.

```{r}
assays(sce_obj)
```

We can also interact with our object as we do with any tidyverse tibble.

## Tidyverse commands

We can use tidyverse commands, such as `filter`, `select` and `mutate` to explore the tidySingleCellExperiment object. Some examples are shown below and more can be seen at the tidySingleCellExperiment website [here](https://stemangiola.github.io/tidySingleCellExperiment/articles/introduction.html#tidyverse-commands-1).

We can use `filter` to choose rows, for example, to see just the rows for the cells in G1 cell-cycle stage.

```{r}
sce_obj |> filter(Phase == "G1")
```

We can use `select` to view columns, for example, to see the filename, total cellular RNA abundance and cell phase.

* If we use `select` we will also get any view-only columns returned, such as the UMAP columns generated during the preprocessing.

```{r}
sce_obj |> select(.cell, file, nCount_RNA, Phase)
```

We can use `mutate` to create a column. For example, we could create a new `Phase_l` column that contains a lower-case version of `Phase`.

```{r message=FALSE}
sce_obj |>
  mutate(Phase_l = tolower(Phase)) |>
  select(.cell, Phase, Phase_l)
```

We can use tidyverse commands to polish an annotation column. We will extract the sample, and group information from the file name column into separate columns.

```{r message=FALSE}
# First take a look at the file column
sce_obj |> select(.cell, file)
```

```{r}
# Create column for sample
sce_obj <- sce_obj |>
  # Extract sample
  extract(file, "sample", "../data/.*/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)/outs.+", remove = FALSE)

# Take a look
sce_obj |> select(.cell, sample, everything())
```

We could use tidyverse `unite` to combine columns, for example to create a new column for sample id combining the sample and patient id (BCB) columns.

```{r message=FALSE}
sce_obj <- sce_obj |> unite("sample_id", sample, BCB, remove = FALSE)

# Take a look
sce_obj |> select(.cell, sample_id, sample, BCB)
```


# Part 2 Signature visualisation

## Data pre-processing

The object `sce_obj` we've been using was created as part of a study on breast cancer systemic immune response. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been sequenced for RNA at the single-cell level. The steps used to generate the object are summarised below.

-   `scran`, `scater`, and `DropletsUtils` packages have been used to eliminate empty droplets and dead cells. Samples were individually quality checked and cells were filtered for good gene coverage.

-   Variable features were identified using `modelGeneVar`.

-   Read counts were scaled and normalised using logNormCounts from `scuttle`.

-   Data integration was performed using `fastMNN` with default parameters.

-   PCA performed to reduce feature dimensionality.

-   Nearest-neighbor cell networks were calculated using 30 principal components.

-   2 UMAP dimensions were calculated using 30 principal components.

-   Cells with similar transcriptome profiles were grouped into clusters using Louvain clustering from `scran`.

## Analyse custom signature

The researcher analysing this dataset wanted to identify gamma delta T cells using a gene signature from a published paper [@Pizzolato2019]. We'll show how that can be done here.

With tidySingleCellExperiment's `join_features` we can view the counts for genes in the signature as columns joined to our single cell tibble.

```{r}
sce_obj |>
  join_features(c("CD3D", "TRDC", "TRGC1", "TRGC2", "CD8A", "CD8B"), shape = "wide")
```

We can use tidyverse `mutate` to create a column containing the signature score. To generate the score, we scale the sum of the 4 genes, CD3D, TRDC, TRGC1, TRGC2, and subtract the scaled sum of the 2 genes, CD8A and CD8B. `mutate` is powerful in enabling us to perform complex arithmetic operations easily.

```{r}
sce_obj |>
    
  join_features(c("CD3D", "TRDC", "TRGC1", "TRGC2", "CD8A", "CD8B"), shape = "wide") |>
    
  mutate(
    signature_score =
      scales::rescale(CD3D + TRDC + TRGC1 + TRGC2, to = c(0, 1)) -
        scales::rescale(CD8A + CD8B, to = c(0, 1))
  ) |>
    
  select(.cell, signature_score, everything())
```

The gamma delta T cells could then be visualised by the signature score using Bioconductor's visualisation functions.

```{r}
sce_obj |>
    
  join_features(
    features = c("CD3D", "TRDC", "TRGC1", "TRGC2", "CD8A", "CD8B"), shape = "wide"
  ) |>
    
  mutate(
    signature_score =
      scales::rescale(CD3D + TRDC + TRGC1 + TRGC2, to = c(0, 1)) -
        scales::rescale(CD8A + CD8B, to = c(0, 1))
  ) |>
    
  scater::plotUMAP(colour_by = "signature_score")
```

The cells could also be visualised using the popular and powerful `ggplot2` package, enabling the researcher to use ggplot functions they were familiar with, and to customise the plot with great flexibility.

```{r}
sce_obj |>
    
  join_features(
    features = c("CD3D", "TRDC", "TRGC1", "TRGC2", "CD8A", "CD8B"), shape = "wide"
  ) |>
    
  mutate(
    signature_score =
      scales::rescale(CD3D + TRDC + TRGC1 + TRGC2, to = c(0, 1)) -
        scales::rescale(CD8A + CD8B, to = c(0, 1))
  ) |>
    
  # plot cells with high score last so they're not obscured by other cells
  arrange(signature_score) |>
    
  ggplot(aes(UMAP_1, UMAP_2, color = signature_score)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "Spectral") +
  tidyomicsWorkshop::theme_multipanel
```

For exploratory analyses, we can select the gamma delta T cells, the red cluster on the left with high signature score. We'll filter for cells with a signature score > 0.7.

```{r}
sce_obj_gamma_delta <-
    
  sce_obj |>
    
  join_features(
    features = c("CD3D", "TRDC", "TRGC1", "TRGC2", "CD8A", "CD8B"), shape = "wide"
  ) |>
    
  mutate(
    signature_score =
      scales::rescale(CD3D + TRDC + TRGC1 + TRGC2, to = c(0, 1)) -
        scales::rescale(CD8A + CD8B, to = c(0, 1))
  ) |>
    
	# Proper cluster selection should be used instead (see supplementary material)
  filter(signature_score > 0.7)
```

For comparison, we show the alternative using base R and SingleCellExperiment. Note that the code contains more redundancy and intermediate objects.

```{r eval=FALSE}
counts_positive <-
  assay(sce_obj, "logcounts")[c("CD3D", "TRDC", "TRGC1", "TRGC2"), ] |>
  colSums() |>
  scales::rescale(to = c(0, 1))

counts_negative <-
  assay(sce_obj, "logcounts")[c("CD8A", "CD8B"), ] |>
  colSums() |>
  scales::rescale(to = c(0, 1))

sce_obj$signature_score <- counts_positive - counts_negative

sce_obj_gamma_delta <- sce_obj[, sce_obj$signature_score > 0.7]
```

We can then focus on just these gamma delta T cells and chain Bioconductor and tidyverse commands together to analyse.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(batchelor)
library(scater)

sce_obj_gamma_delta <-
    
  sce_obj_gamma_delta |>
    
  # Integrate - using batchelor.
  multiBatchNorm(batch = colData(sce_obj_gamma_delta)$sample) |>
  fastMNN(batch = colData(sce_obj_gamma_delta)$sample) |>
    
  # Join metadata removed by fastMNN - using tidyverse
  left_join(as_tibble(sce_obj_gamma_delta)) |>
    
  # Dimension reduction - using scater
  runUMAP(ncomponents = 2, dimred = "corrected")
```

Visualise gamma delta T cells. As we have used rough threshold we are left with only few cells. Proper cluster selection should be used instead (see supplementary material).

```{r}	
sce_obj_gamma_delta |> plotUMAP()	
```


It is also possible to visualise the cells as a 3D plot using plotly.
The example data used here only contains a few genes, for the sake of time and size in this demonstration, but below is how you could generate the 3 dimensions needed for 3D plot with a full dataset. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
single_cell_object |>
  RunUMAP(dims = 1:30, n.components = 3L, spread = 0.5, min.dist = 0.01, n.neighbors = 10L)
```

We'll demonstrate creating a 3D plot using some data that has 3 UMAP dimensions. This is a fantastic way to visualise both reduced dimensions and metadata in the same representation. 

```{r umap plot 2, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidySingleCellExperiment)
pbmc <- tidyomicsWorkshop::sce_obj_UMAP3

pbmc |>
  ttservice::plot_ly(
    x = ~`UMAP_1`,
    y = ~`UMAP_2`,
    z = ~`UMAP_3`,
    color = ~cell_type,
    colors = dittoSeq::dittoColors()
  ) %>%
  plotly::add_markers(size = I(1))
```

## Exercises

Using the `sce_obj`:

1. What proportion of all cells are gamma-delta T cells? Use signature_score > 0.7 to identify gamma-delta T cells.

2. There is a cluster of cells characterised by a low RNA output (nCount_RNA < 100). Identify the cell composition (cell_type) of that cluster.

# Part 3 Nested analyses

When analysing single cell data is sometimes necessary to perform calculations on data subsets. For example, we might want to estimate difference in mRNA abundance between two condition for each cell type. 

`tidyr` and `purrr` offer a great tool to perform iterativre analyses in a functional way.

We use tidyverse `nest` to group the data. The command below will create a tibble containing a column with a SummarizedExperiment object for each cell type. `nest` is similar to tidyverse `group_by`, except with `nest` each group is stored in a single row, and can be a complex object such as `SingleCellExperiment`.

Let's import some libraries

```{r}
library(purrr)
```

First let's have a look to the cell types that constitute this dataset

```{r nest SingleCellExperiment count}
sce_obj |> 
  dplyr::count(cell_type)
```

Let's group the cells based on cell identity using `nest`

```{r nest SingleCellExperiment }

sce_obj_nested = 
  sce_obj |> 
  nest(sce = -cell_type) 

sce_obj_nested
```

Let's see what the first element of the Surat column looks like

```{r nest sce 2}
sce_obj_nested |> 
  dplyr::slice(1) |> 
  pull(sce)
```

Now, let's perform a differential gene-transcript abundance analysis between the two conditions for each cell type.

```{r nest sce integrate, message=FALSE}
sce_obj_nested = 
  sce_obj_nested |> 
  
  # Filter for sample with more than 30 cells
  mutate(sce = map(sce, ~ .x |> add_count(sample) |> filter(n > 50))) |>
  filter(map_int(sce, ncol) > 0) |>

  # Select significant genes
  mutate(sce = imap(
    sce,
    ~ .x %>% {print(.y); (.)} |> 
    
    # Integrate - using batchelor.
    multiBatchNorm(batch = colData(.x)$sample) |>
    fastMNN(batch = colData(.x)$sample) |>
      
    # Join metadata removed by fastMNN - using tidyverse
    left_join(as_tibble(.x)) |>
      
    # Dimension reduction - using scater
    runUMAP(ncomponents = 2, dimred = "corrected")
  
  ))

sce_obj_nested
```

We can the lies the top genes with the heat map iteratively across the cell types

```{r nest sce heatmap, message=FALSE}
sce_obj_nested = 
  sce_obj_nested |> 
  
  # Build heatmaps
  mutate(umap = map(sce,plotUMAP)) 

sce_obj_nested
```

Let's have a look to the first heatmap

```{r nest sce heatmap 2, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
sce_obj_nested |> 
  dplyr::slice(1) |> 
  pull(umap)
```

You can do this whole analysis without saving any temporary variable using the piping functionality of tidy R programming 

```{r nest sce heatmap all, eval=FALSE}
sce_obj |> 
  
  # Nest
  nest(sce = -cell_type) |> 
  
  # Filter for sample with more than 30 cells
  mutate(sce = map(sce, ~ .x |> add_count(sample) |> dplyr::filter(n > 50))) |>
  filter(map_int(sce, ncol) > 0) |>

  # Select significant genes
  mutate(sce = imap(
    sce,
    ~ .x %>% {print(.y); (.)} |> 
    
    # Integrate - using batchelor.
    multiBatchNorm(batch = colData(.x)$sample) |>
    fastMNN(batch = colData(.x)$sample) |>
      
    # Join metadata removed by fastMNN - using tidyverse
    left_join(as_tibble(.x)) |>
      
    # Dimension reduction - using scater
    runUMAP(ncomponents = 2, dimred = "corrected")
  
  )) |>
  
   # Build heatmaps
  mutate(umap = map(sce,plotUMAP))  |> 
  
  # Extract heatmaps
  pull(umap)
```

### Exercises

1. Let's suppose that you want to perform the analyses only for cell types that have a total number of cells bigger than 1000. For example, if a cell type has less than a sum of 1000 cells across all samples, that cell type will be dropped from the dataset.

- Answer this question avoiding to save temporary variables, and using the function add_count to count the cells (before nesting), and then filter
- Answer this question avoiding to save temporary variables, and using the function map_int to count the cells (after nesting), and the filter
